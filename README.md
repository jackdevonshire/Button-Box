This is my attempt at creating my very own Button Box, fully documented for anyone to follow along if they want to give it ago!

## How To Guide?

The whole build process is fully documented in [this Github's wiki](https://github.com/jackdevonshire/Button-Box/wiki)

## Current Features
* Fully wireless (no wires needed at all with powerbank), with no need to log into Rasperry Pi after first setup
* Map buttons to
  * Keyboard Shortcuts
  * Custom Python Scripts
  * Command Line executions (e.g. open chrome to specific website)
* Ability to create multiple button configurations and switch between these - for different games / use cases etc

## Wish List
These are the features I would love to add given the time
* Scrolling messages that aren't limited to 4x20 character lines
* Support for different display types
* Implement [headless WIFI setup](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/wifi-connect-headless-rpi) so the button box works across different networks
